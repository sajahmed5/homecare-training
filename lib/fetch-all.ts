/**

 */

/**
 * Read every row a query matches, a page at a time.
 *
 * Supabase returns at most 1,000 rows per request (`max_rows`) and silently
 * drops the rest — no error. These jobs run across every organisation at once,
 * so they were the first thing to cross that line: past row 1,000, reminders
 * and certificate expiries would simply not happen, with nothing in the logs.
 *
 * Advances by the rows actually received rather than a fixed page size, so it
 * stays correct if the server's cap is ever lowered; the caller must order by
 * a unique column so pages don't overlap. A failed read throws: a job acting
 * on half the data is exactly the silent failure this exists to prevent.
