 * Chase one learner about a certificate that has lapsed or is about to.
 *
 * The ordinary Remind button can't do this job. It emails about *outstanding*
 * training, and a certificate that expires next month belongs to a course the
 * learner has completed — so there is nothing outstanding and it would send
 * nothing at all. (Once a certificate actually lapses the daily engine flips
 * the enrolment back to "expired", so that half would eventually work; the
 * weeks of warning beforehand are the part that matters and the part that was
 * unreachable.)
 *
 * So this names the certificate, its date, and whether it has already gone.
 * Always sends: a deliberate click on one named person.
