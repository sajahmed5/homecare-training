    "Do you deliver training across Greater Manchester?",

  ],
  [
    "Is this classroom training or online?",
    "Online. Every course runs in a browser on a phone, tablet or computer, and most are finished in about 20 minutes. Mock CQC inspections and management support are arranged separately — ask us and we will talk it through.",
  ],
  [
    "How quickly can new starters be training?",
    "The same day. You add them, pick their courses and set a due date; they get one email with a link to set a password and start.",
  ],
  [
    "Who is behind it?",
    "A home care company in Stockport that has been running since 2002. We built this for our own carers first, and our own staff still take the same courses.",
  ],
  [
    "Will the certificates satisfy CQC?",
    "Each pass produces a certificate with a number anyone can check on this site, so an inspector can confirm it without taking your word for it. Expiry dates are tracked, and your whole training matrix exports to a spreadsheet.",
  ],
  [
    "What does it cost?",
    "One monthly price for the whole service, with unlimited learners and admin users — no per-carer charge and no add-on modules. The plans are on the pricing page.",

              We are not a training company that moved into care. We started a
              home care service in Stockport in 2002 and still run it. The
              courses exist because we needed them: carers who work across
              Greater Manchester, shifts that leave no room for a classroom
              day, and an inspector who wants evidence rather than a promise.
