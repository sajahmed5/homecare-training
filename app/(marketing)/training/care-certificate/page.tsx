  [
    "How many standards are in the Care Certificate?",
    `There are ${OFFICIAL_STANDARDS}, from "Understand your role" to "Infection prevention and control". We add a sixteenth course on learning disability and autism, because providers are expected to cover it for new staff and an induction without it is incomplete.`,
  ],
  [
    "Can the Care Certificate be done entirely online?",
    "No, and be careful of anyone who says otherwise. E-learning covers the knowledge element. Full achievement also needs each standard observed in real work and signed off by the employer. We give your assessors somewhere to record those observations, attach evidence and award the certificate.",
  ],
  [
    "How long does it take?",
    "The knowledge courses are about 20 minutes each, so a new starter can work through them in their first weeks between shifts. The workplace observations take as long as competence takes — that part is your judgement, not a timer.",
  ],
  [
    "Who is it for?",
    "New care workers and healthcare assistants in their induction, and anyone moving into care from another sector. Experienced staff often take it too when a service wants a consistent baseline.",
  ],
  [
    "Is it transferable between employers?",
    "The Care Certificate is portable in principle, but each employer is responsible for satisfying itself that a new starter is competent. Our certificates carry a number any employer can check online, which makes that conversation shorter.",
  ],
  [
    "Does it cost extra?",
    "The courses are part of the library, so they are included in every plan at no extra charge. Workplace observation and sign-off is an add-on — ask us and we will explain what it involves.",
  ],
];

  ["Assign the pathway", "Add the new starter and assign the Care Certificate courses with a due date. They get one email to set a password and begin.", GraduationCap],
