const FAQ: [string, string][] = [
  [
    "Is there an official list of mandatory training for care staff?",
    "No single list applies to every service. Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 requires that staff get the training and support their role needs, and it is for the provider to decide what that means for its service and to evidence the decision. The subjects on this page are the ones care services are routinely expected to cover.",
  ],
  [
    "How often does mandatory training need refreshing?",
    "There is no universal legal interval for most subjects. Annual is the common practice for the high-risk ones — safeguarding, moving and handling, infection control, basic life support, medication — and longer for others. Set your own policy, apply it consistently, and be able to show when each person last completed each subject.",
  ],
  [
    "Does e-learning count as mandatory training?",
    "For knowledge-based subjects, yes, and it is what most services use. Practical competence — a hoist transfer, administering medication — also needs observing in practice. A sensible policy pairs the two and says which is which.",
  ],
  [
    "What does CQC actually ask to see?",
    "Who has done what, when, and what you did about the gaps. A training matrix showing every member of staff against every subject answers the first part; dated certificates answer the second; your reminders and reassignments answer the third.",
  ],
  [
    "What about agency and bank staff?",
    "The same expectation applies to anyone delivering care on your behalf. Either verify the training they arrive with or assign your own — our plans include unlimited learners, so adding bank staff costs nothing extra.",
  ],
  [
    "How do we start from nothing?",
    `Assign the core subjects to everyone with a realistic due date, then work the overdue list down. All ${COURSE_COUNT} courses are included in every plan, so the cost does not change with how much catching up you have to do.`,
