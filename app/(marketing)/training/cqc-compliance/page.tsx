/**
 * CQC training and mock inspections (7 Oct 2026).
 *
 * The research behind the SEO work found the two searches are served by
 * different people: course libraries sell CQC-aligned training, consultancies
 * sell mock inspections, and nobody sells both. We do, so this page says so
 * in one place rather than leaving it as three bullet points on /training.
 *
 * Mock-inspection and governance detail is the same copy as lib/services —
 * what is actually delivered, not a wish list.

  [
    "What makes training CQC-aligned?",
    `Regulation 18 requires that staff receive the training and support they need for their role. Our ${COURSE_COUNT} courses cover the mandatory subjects a care service is expected to evidence, each with an assessment and a dated certificate, so "we trained them" becomes something you can show rather than say.`,
  ],
  [
    "What happens in a mock CQC inspection?",
    "A consultant experienced in your type of service visits, announced or unannounced — your choice, agreed in advance. They assess against the five key questions and the Fundamental Standards, then send a written report within 10 working days with an estimated rating, any breaches and a prioritised action plan.",
  ],
  [
    "Can you inspect before our real inspection?",
    "That is usually why providers call. Tell us your situation when you get in touch and we will be straight with you about what can be arranged and what it would cover.",
  ],
  [
    "Do you only work with services that use the training?",
    "No. Mock inspections and management support are quoted separately, based on the size of your service, and can be arranged whether or not you use our e-learning.",
  ],
  [
    "How do we show an inspector our training position?",
    "Three ways: the training matrix exported to a spreadsheet, every carer's own record with dates, and certificates carrying a number the inspector can check on this site without taking your word for it.",
  ],
  [
    "What if a carer's training has lapsed?",
    "Expiry dates are tracked, and training that is running out is flagged before it does. Certificates last 12 months, so a service that keeps up with the reminders does not get caught out at an inspection.",
  ],
